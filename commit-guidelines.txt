- Commits that aren't full sentences should not have a capital at the start or a full stop at the end.
- Commits to multiple files should be split up for a seperate commit per file.
- Commits should have a filename (without any paths) and a short decription of WHAT you did as the first line
  and on the third line (second line is whitespace) should be a decent description of WHY you did that thing.
- Commits that mention my Emacs packages (ysz-utils.el) etc.. should not have a file extension in the commit summary.
- Commits that mention anything else like a normal file (e.g config.el), should keep the file extension in the commit summary.
- Descriptions of the commit don't usually need bullet points.
- Additions / removals for files should again have short summaries, and should mention the package, e.g:
  dotfiles: add abc.txt
  It would be visible here:
  WHERE-THE-REPO-WAS-CLONED/abc.txt
  Or for a package:
  emacs: add abc.el
  It would be visible here:
  WHERE-THE-REPO-WAS-CLONED/emacs/abc.el

- Protesilaos' dotfiles have good commit messages, I should take inspiration from his format:
